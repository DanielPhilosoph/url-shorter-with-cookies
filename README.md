## Project Goals

1. Shorten a very long URL address with either automatic generation or by creating a custom URL.
2. Analyze the amount of page views per the URL that the user created by using statistics, and vizualization tools (ex: graphs).

## Features

- [ ] Automatically generate a unique URL that the server returns that can be used for personal gain.
- [ ] Users have the ability to name the URL based on their website's content in order to improve their goal infront of their website users.
- [ ] Showcasing the amount of entries per URL allows the managing user to keep track on the URL's usage & status.

## Persistent Information

- [ ] File collection system that allows saving the shortened URLs within a `JSON` file.
- [ ] Here's an example of a generated shortened URL:

_#1.json_

```json
{
  "redirectCount": 7,

  "redirectEntriesLog": [
    "2021-11-03T14:29:40.116Z",
    "2021-11-03T14:29:44.146Z",
    "2021-11-03T14:29:48.046Z",
    "2021-11-03T14:39:37.323Z",
    "2021-11-03T16:25:19.754Z",
    "2021-11-04T07:53:40.197Z",
    "2021-11-04T09:17:13.563Z"
  ],

  "creationDate": "03-11-2021",

  "originalUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/",
  "shorturl-id": 1
}
```

`redirectCount` - The amount of times the user redirected the shortened URL.

`redirectEntriesLog` - Saves the time of every entry. (allows to properly analyze URL entries)

## API End-points (api/shorterurl)

- Method: `get`, <label style="color:green"> _end-point /:urlid_ </label>

  - Redirect the user to the original URL.

- Method: `get`, _end-point /info/:urlid_
  - Returns shortened URL info (json in file, \_as mentioned in 'Persistent Information')
- Method: `post`, _end-point /custom_

  - Generates a short URL based on user input. (the custom URL is in the body of the request)

  ```js

     let response = await axios.post(
       "/api/shorturl/custom",
     {
       url: fullUrl,
       custom: custom,
     }
  ```

  - Returns `{ custom: string }`

- Method: `post`, _endpoint /_

  - Generate a short URL based on API generator. (the custom URL is in the body of the request)

  ```js
  let response = await axios.post("/api/shorturl/", {
    url: fullUrl,
  });
  ```

  - Returns `{ shorturlId: number }`

## Error Handling

- [ ] Error 402: Could not read or write to DB / max capacity of short URLs.
- [ ] Error 403: URL does not exist.
- [ ] Error 405: Custom URL already exists.
- [ ] Error 500: Internal erver error.

## API Port

- `if localy` = 3000
- `process.env.PORT` = 443
